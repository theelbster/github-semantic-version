## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev github-semantic-version
```

### 2. Add `GH_TOKEN` & `NPM_TOKEN` to CI

For example, in Travis CI's "Settings" tab for your project, you'll see:
> ![tokens](tokens.png)

For your `GH_TOKEN` [create one in Github](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
with `repo` credentials.

You can find `NPM_TOKEN` in your `~/.npmrc` file:

```
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

Once these are in place, your new versions can be pushed back to Github & NPM
without permissions & security issues.

### 3. Create labels

From your repo's `Issues > Labels` section, add three labels representing the major, minor, and patch level changes in your repo. Ex:

- "Version: Major"
- "Version: Minor"
- "Version: Patch"

Add your label definitions to a `gsv` section of `package.json`, to a `gsv.json` file, or a `.gsvrc` file in the base directory of your project.

##### package.json example
```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "majorLabel": "Version: Major",
    "minorLabel": "Version: Minor",
    "patchLabel": "Version: Patch"
  }
}
```

##### gsv.json or .gsvrc example
```json
{
  "majorLabel": "Version: Major",
  "minorLabel": "Version: Minor",
  "patchLabel": "Version: Patch"
}
```

#### Non-version Labels

Sometimes a PR should not increment and publish a new version, for example, when updating dependencies, tests, or docs. To support
this, a 4th label named `internalLabel` can be used. When this label is found on a PR, it will be skipped.

```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "majorLabel": "Version: Major",
    "minorLabel": "Version: Minor",
    "patchLabel": "Version: Patch",
    "internalLabel": "No version: Internal"
  }
}
```

### 4. Add labels to issues

Add one of your _custom defined labels_ to your open PRs:

As these get merged, `github-semantic-version` will use this to determine
how to bump the current version. _PRs merged without a label will be treated
as `patch` releases._

_If any un-tagged commits are pushed to `master` outside of a PR, they're
automatically treated as `patch` releases._

### 5. Update `.travis.yml`

```yaml
sudo: false
language: node_js
cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules
notifications:
  email: false
branches:
  except:
    - /^v[0-9]/
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: npm run release
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    branch: master
```

### 6. Usage

As automation related to your code and publishing to the world can sometimes be scary, `github-semantic-version` operates with an _additive functionality_ philosophy. 

To indicate you are in a CI environment, the CI envvar must be defined. It doesn't matter what the value is.

#### Options

`github-semantic-version`

Displays the usage information.

`github-semantic-version --bump`

Update the package version, no CHANGELOG, don't push to Github, don't publish to NPM.

_Meant to be used in a CI environment._

`github-semantic-version --init`

Generates a fresh CHANGELOG based on labeled PRs and any commits to `master` outside
of any PR. Also calculates the package version based on those PRs and commits. Won't push to Github or publish to NPM.

_Meant to be used outside of a CI environment to generate the initial CHANGELOG._

The expected workflow here is to ensure parity between the calculated version/changelog and your current repo version. Once that happens, you'll
want to manually commit those changes (adding github-semantic-version as a dependency, the new npm scripts to run on CI success, the CHANGELOG,
updated package.json, etc.) to master (or merge a labeled PR). Once CI builds successfully, these additions will be noted in the CHANGELOG (assuming
that you specified the `--changelog` flag in your npm scripts).

`github-semantic-version --changelog`

Append the latest change to an
existing CHANGELOG (must have already been generated by the `--init` flag above).

You'll want to run `github-semantic-version --init` outside of CI to generate the initial CHANGELOG
before enabling the `--changelog` flag.

`github-semantic-version --bump --changelog`

Bump the version and append the latest change to the CHANGELOG.

`github-semantic-version --bump --changelog --push`

Bump the version, append the latest change to the CHANGELOG, and push the changes to Github.

`github-semantic-version --bump --changelog --push --publish`

Bump the version, append the latest change to the CHANGELOG, push to Github, and publish to NPM.

#### Other flags

`--force`

The flags `--bump` and `--changelog` are meant to be used in a CI environment. _Override this if you know what you're doing._

`--dry-run`

Append this to see output of what _would_ happen without any writing to files, pushing to Github, or publishing to NPM.

#### Debug

Prepend `DEBUG=github-semantic-version:*` to the `github-semantic-version` command to show all debug output when running.

### 7. Update `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prerelease": "npm run build",
    "release": "github-semantic-version --bump --changelog --push --publish"
  }
}
```

#### startVersion

You can add a `startVersion` to the `gsv` section of `package.json` (or to `gsv.json`) that will be used as the starting point to
calculate the package version of a repo. Ex:

```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "startVersion": "2.5.0",
    "majorLabel": "Version: Major"
  }
}
```

If you're working on a private project, you can leave out `--publish`, which
means you have no need for your `NPM_TOKEN` either.

#### github

You can add a `github` object to the `gsv` section of `package.json` (or to `gsv.json`),
which are options that will be passed to the [Github API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github).

```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "github": {
      "host": "github.my-GHE-enabled-company.com"
    }
  }
}
```

#### abortOnMissingLabel

By default, all PRs without a label will default to "patch". If you'd prefer to skip the PR instead of releasing, use the `abortOnMissingLabel` option.

```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "abortOnMissingLabel": true
  }
}
```

#### addReleasedLabelOnSuccess

Define the `addReleasedLabelOnSuccess` and `releasedLabel` options to add a label to a PR once it has been successfully published.

```json
{
  "gsv": {
    "releasedLabel": "Released",
    "addReleasedLabelOnSuccess": true
  }
}
```

> The `releasedLabel` defaults to "Released".
